# GenAI & LLM Learning Lab

Welcome to my curated collection of hands-on experiments and applied learning in
**Generative AI (GenAI)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** — built with thes
indset of scaling ideas into impact.

This repository reflects my commitment to not just understanding GenAI at a 
technical level, but exploring its **practical applications across real-world use cases**,
developer workflows, and domain-specific reasoning systems.

Designed for technologists and engineering leaders who value clean, modular, and scalable
AI explorations.

As GenAI moves from hype to production, the true differentiators are **deep understanding, 
thoughtful implementation**, and **cross-functional integration**. 

This lab represents:

- A hands-on **validation of LLM concepts and capabilities**
- An exploration of **AI agent patterns, embeddings, RAG workflows**
- An evolving toolkit for building **LLM-powered applications at scale**

## Repository Structure

| Folder                      | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `1_prompt_engineering/`     | Advanced prompt workflows: zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, code generation, reasoning prompts |
| `2_embeddings_vectorstores/`| Semantic search, RAG systems, Keras-based classifiers using embeddings |
| `3_agents/`                 | LangGraph-based agents, Gemini function-calling, tool-using LLMs |
| `4_domain_specific_llm/`    | Experiments with Google Search grounding and custom fine-tuning for vertical-specific use cases |

This repository is most relevant to:
- **Engineering Leaders** evaluating applied LLM capabilities in their teams
- **Hiring Managers** looking for hands-on LLM talent with a strategic mindset
- **Developers and architects** exploring the LLM stack for product innovation

If you're exploring GenAI-powered platforms, developer AI tooling, or domain-specific reasoning engines, 
I'd be happy to exchange ideas or collaborate on aligned goals.

Use it, fork it, star it and share it — knowledge grows when shared.
